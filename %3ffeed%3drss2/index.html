			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The provisional Quarterly National Statistics on possession claim actions in county courts by mortgage lenders in England and Wales have been published by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ).</p>
<p>The figures supplied represent court actions for possession and not actual home repossessions between April and June 2012. The statistics are a leading indicator of the number of properties to be repossessed.</p>
<p>In the second quarter the number of claims that were issued was 14,614, of which 11,328 led to a possession order made by a judge. This is a slightly lower number than Q1 of 2012 which saw 16,963 claims being issued with 12,753 orders being made. The MoJ apply a seasonal adjustment to the figures to remove the impact of seasonal effects to give a better view of the overall trend. When the seasonal adjustments were applied, the number of claims issued in Q2 was 15,050, with 11,642 resulting in a possession order. According to the MoJ calculations, this is an 8% decrease compared with Q1 in 2012.</p>
<p>The MoJ also provides figures for the percentage of first possession orders that were suspended. In Q2, the provisional figure is 49% of first possession orders being suspended compared to 50% in Q1 in 2012 and 49% in Q4 in 2011.</p>
<p>The downward trend of possession claims being issued and orders being made since 2008 continues, where the number of claims averaged 35,500 per quarter and the number of orders averaged 27,900 per quarter.</p>
<p>The figures published by the CML on the number of properties actually taken into possession during the same period support the MoJ&#8217;s figures. At 8,500, the number of possessions in the three months to June was the lowest since the final quarter of 2010. The decline in the second quarter, from a total of 9,600 possessions in the first three months of 2012, was in line with a seasonal pattern that has been seen in each of the last three years.</p>
<p>According to figures supplied by Finance &amp; Leasing Association (FLA), repossessions made by second charge mortgage providers were down by a third during the second quarter of the year. The number of repossessions is reported to be 147, down from 234 for the same period last year and 157 for the first three months of 2012.</p>
<p>The CML&#8217;s director-general Paul Smee said: “The figures show that lenders, borrowers and debt advisers are working together to get through the current period of economic difficulty and keep mortgage possessions in check.</p>
<p>&#8220;Generally, when borrowers prioritise their mortgage commitments, lenders can provide help appropriate to their individual circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;But success in managing temporary payment problems depends on everyone working together, it is essential for anyone worried about their mortgage to talk to their lender as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The figures show that the repossessions for 2012 seem to be on track to be lower than 2011 and at the lowest since 2007. The decrease in repossessions has occurred in spite of the recession and high levels of unemployment. Low interest rates and help for unemployed mortgage borrowers has no doubt had an effect on repossessions, however should there be a further downturn in the economy we could see a dramatic increase in repossessions as it becomes harder for lenders to support borrowers in financial difficulties.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On 9 August 2012, the OFT revoked the licence of short-term lender MCO Capital for failures relating to how it operated and for ineffective anti-money laundering controls.</p>
<p>MCO Capital, which previously operated online under the name of Helploan, had fallen victim to an organised loan fraud in 2011. Fraudsters had used the personal details of over 7,000 individuals to obtain millions of pounds of loan money. When these loans were not repaid, the individuals were chased aggressively by the lender for the return of the money which had been paid out to the fraudsters. The OFT considered that it was the lack of anti-money laundering controls, and in particular, its failure to operate any substantive ID checks, which meant MCO was an easy target for the fraud. It ordered the lender to stop seeking to recover the loss from those whose details had been fraudulently used, but the OFT later uncovered evidence to suggest that MCO had continued to chase people despite knowing that they had been duped in the scam.</p>
<p>It was for these reasons, together with the fact that in all the circumstances the OFT considered that the lender did not demonstrate the necessary skills and expertise to hold a consumer credit licence, that it decided on the revocation. MCO Capital, which trades online under the brands Speed Credit, Paycheck Credit and Pop Credit, has 28 days to appeal, an avenue it says it is considering.   </p>
<p>The OFT has broad powers to vary, revoke and suspend consumer credit licences under s25 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. All licensed businesses need to consider the various forms of guidance which supplement this statutory provision, particularly as the power to revoke is going to be given extra teeth when the Financial Services Bill comes into effect next year.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ministry of Justice recently released its annual report on claims management companies, and this shows that while business is still booming in the sector, close attention is being paid to compliance issues.</p>
<p>The report relates to the period between April 2011 and March 2012, and shows that just over 3,000 businesses are currently authorised to carry on claims management activity. Over the period, authorisations were removed from 260 businesses, with a similar number of suspensions and warnings being issued. As might be expected, there has been an increase in the number of applications in respect of PPI mis-selling claims, as more businesses enter the potentially lucrative arena. This increase can be seen in the turnover in the financial services part of the sector which has risen by 66%, to £313million. However, such a rise is also mirrored in the complaints received by the Ministry, with 93% of them relating to financial services, and particularly PPI.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that a dedicated team has been set up to focus on the PPI businesses, with the aim of rooting out poor practices and improving consumer protection. Of particular note is the marketing angle, with unsolicited calls and texts making up a large proportion of the complaints. There is also emerging evidence of a practice among firms of making claims even where no policy has been taken out, and of using the same template each time: a ‘one size fits all’ approach which does not reflect individual circumstances. And such an approach does not reflect the fees consumers pay for the service, which typically amounts to 25% of the amount re-claimed.</p>
<p>But although overall the number of authorised businesses has increased – particularly in the North West – it appears to be the case that consumers are increasingly turning to the Financial Ombudsman Service instead. Perhaps this means that the message has finally sunk in that the claims management industry can do no more than an individual can do on their own behalf: provided they have a valid claim in the first place, of course.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Equality Act 2010 became law last year, with the aim of consolidating the anti-discrimination provisions of various Acts into one source. In a nutshell, it prescribes “protected characteristics”, such as age, gender, race, and then goes on to prohibit any discrimination in the providing of (or refusing to provide) services, goods or facilities based upon those characteristics.</p>
<p>On 1 October 2012, the age discrimination part of the Equality Act becomes law, and in readiness for this, the Government Equalities Office has recently published its detailed guidance. As expected, the financial services exemption provided for in Part 17 remains intact. This means that providers of financial services will be able to use a person’s age as a factor in assessing risk and charging for their products, as is the case currently. Providers will also be able to continue to use age banding and age limits, and also to specialise in products only for certain age groups. However, when making such risk assessments based on age factors, the provider involved must base that assessment on relevant information from a source upon which it is reasonable to rely.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The statutory instrument giving effect to the new offence of squatting in residential buildings has now been made, bringing the provisions into force with effect from 1 September 2012. This means that anyone found squatting in a residential building on or after that date will be liable to prosecution under s144 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, even if they entered the building in question prior to the effective date. The prescribed penalty is imprisonment for a period up to 51 weeks, and/or a level 5 fine – currently capped at £5,000. However, another, less sensational provision in the Act will increase the powers of the Magistrates’ Court and allow the imposition of an unlimited fine. There is no date set for the removal of the fines cap, but it looks like squatting will become even more onerous than originally thought. In the meantime, the government has hinted that it may well consider extending the offence to cover commercial premises too.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Mark Firth, Business Development Manager</p>
<p>There comes a time in every Collection Manager’s or Credit Manager’s working life when those infamous words stare up from the debtor&#8217;s account details screen &#8211; Kirkintilloch, Oban, Bishopbriggs and Kilwinning.</p>
<p>The immediate sinking feeling is often followed by a resignation that although Scotland is so close, in terms of location, in collecting debts and certainly in issuing legal proceedings, it may as well be on another planet.</p>
<p>Often businesses that have a limited or no understanding of the Scottish Legal System for recovery of debt are confused by the procedural rules and terminology.</p>
<p>Through better understanding and promotion of the solutions and procedures to collect debt through the Scottish Courts, knowledge has improved in recent years. However, there are still many English and Welsh companies, including Debt Collection Agencies and Debt Purchasers who do not understand the potential benefits of the Scottish Court System.</p>
<p>In an age where we are all measured on performance and flexibility, using a Solicitor with Scottish expertise can make a significant improvement to recovery rates, especially in the DCA market. Selecting a partner who has not only a practice that can deal with the volume issue of accounts as well as one off actions, but also one who understands how to clearly explain the options and progress of those actions can be a daunting task.</p>
<p>All of the options available to creditors in England and Wales are also evident in the Scottish Legal System &#8211; Asset Recovery, Charging Orders, Attachment of Earnings and Insolvency proceedings all play their part, if only by another name.</p>
<p>On closer analysis, the procedures which operate in Scotland are remarkably similar to those in the rest of the UK, with even some added extras in Scotland. For example, a recovery tool open to creditors, post the stage when a Decree or Judgement has been obtained, is the Money Attachment, which allows creditors to recover cash from a debtor &#8211; this can be particularly effective where the debtor operates a cash business and enables Sheriff Officers to call at the debtor’s premises &#8211; on occasion at unsociable hours &#8211; and empty the till, removing all available cash towards the outstanding balance.</p>
<p>In addition, whilst there is the broad equivalent of the Earnings Attachment, in Scotland (where it is known as an Earnings Arrestment), there is no discretion applied to the deductions made to a debtor’s salary meaning that the employer has to deduct a mandatory amount based on statutory scales to be paid to the creditor, resulting in often higher weekly/monthly returns for creditors.</p>
<p>Current personal debt levels are running high in Scotland, as in the rest of the UK. Indeed, there has been a marked increase, over 6% in the last financial year in Debt Payment Programmes under the Debt Arrangement Scheme.</p>
<p>In the Commercial sector, 2011 saw significant increases in both Compulsory Liquidations and Creditor&#8217;s Voluntary Liquidations in Scotland (source Scotland&#8217;s Insolvency Service).</p>
<p>It has already been reported that Scotland is highly exposed to public sector cutbacks. The increasing debt levels in the UK and increasing numbers of individuals who are out of work, perhaps as a result of these cutbacks, is an almost certain indicator of further debt distress down the line.  Unemployment in general, and periods of unemployment following redundancy in particular, are well understood to increase the likelihood of the requirement for a serious debt solution in the coming years.</p>
<p>It is often said that we cannot be &#8220;masters of all trades&#8221; and this is true in relation to Scottish debt litigation. So the solution is simple. Engage the services of a highly reputable solicitors’ with specific expertise in Scottish law, that has the capability and systems to process your debt accounts effectively, within agreed cost parameters and has client managers who appreciate that not everyone south of the border understands the terminology and procedure and has the ability to report back concisely and clearly.</p>
<p>When you have done this I have no doubt that you will be surprised at how close Scotland really is.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lenders need to remain vigilant in ensuring that the firms they instruct have adequate insurance cover. Those which cannot obtain cover on the open market fall into the Assigned Risks Pool (ARP) but this is destined to close in September 2013. Firms in the ARP at that point will need to find insurance cover within 3 months or close.</p>
<p>Two issues are of real concern &#8211; one is the non-payment of premiums by firms in the ARP and the other is the general concern of what prospective cover will remain available for the benefit of clients when the ARP finally shuts down.</p>
<p>Economic conditions remain difficult for many firms but the Solicitors Regulation Authority, aware of its responsibility to the public and the profession, is now taking action against those firms which owe premiums to the ARP, some of which are significant. Fifteen solicitors have recently had sanctions imposed by the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal for failing to pay with five principals suspended from practice indefinitely. Some others received fines of over £20k. There are another fifteen cases waiting to be heard by the SDT and other proceedings are still being lodged. Clearly as D-day looms the issue is becoming more and more concerning.<br />
<strong><br />
Run-off cover extension<br />
</strong>The Law Society has now called for the SRA to extend a scheme that provides indemnity insurance beyond the normal six year run-off cover, primarily as a result of the number of solicitors now leaving private practice and those contemplating retirement. Such a move will provide valuable protection for retired solicitors as well as the public at large. The SRA has now decided to extend the scheme which is managed by the Solicitors Indemnity Fund and funded collectively by the entire profession for a further three years until 2020. However the Society&#8217;s proposal to cap the profession&#8217;s liability at £10m and introduce individual limits was not adopted. The Society will be undertaking further work to consider the impact on future reserves if the provision of this cover is to be managed in the same way beyond 2020.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lord Denning once said, “As a moth is drawn to a flame, so is a litigant drawn to the United States.” This statement was made some time ago, and was reflective of the fact that US society, on the whole, was a more litigious one than its counterpart in the UK. Arguably, the landscape has altered in recent years and there are more litigants in the UK now, managed by an increasingly competitive claims management industry.</p>
<p>And it is these claims managers, backed by the consumer forums accessible on the internet, who have encouraged much of the rise in litigation. There have been several waves of so-called consumer revolutions, and none more notorious or widespread than that relating to PPI.</p>
<p>It is easy to forget that the reason payment protection insurance, or PPI, first came about was because following the last recession, some borrowers required a form of protection to cover them in the event of their being unable to meet financial commitments. The cover was designed to provide peace of mind for those borrowers, although it undoubtedly provided something similar to the lenders too, and as time went on, its significance grew. Additionally, as lending markets became more competitive, the commissions and potential profits which could be squeezed from selling the product meant that it rendered itself particularly prone to mis-selling. Whilst no one would deny that there have been instances of abuse, and that the taking of commissions which amounted to the vast majority of the premium paid by the borrowers was wrong, the original philosophy behind the product was a sound one, and there continues to be a place for it in the financial market place.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was recently reported by the Financial Ombudsman Service that PPI has become the most complained about financial product ever. This is together with the enormous tide of claims that were launched to re-claim the money paid, as well as the payments made by banks without the need for litigation following on from the judicial review decision in April of last year. All in all, an estimated £2 billion has been paid out to date, with the potential for more to follow. </p>
<p>None of this means that every single person who took out a PPI policy was mis-sold, but claims are still being issued, and continue to dominate county court lists up and down the country. There are, however, signs that this particular revolution is coming to an end, with more and more claims being dismissed. On reviewing the relevant cases to look for indications as to why this might be happening, one reason seems to be that the courts are becoming less sympathetic to litigants who fail to take certain procedural steps, such as filing allocation questionnaires in accordance with directions. But the main reason seems to fall to evidence, and witness evidence in particular.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is not overly surprising, as it is to be expected that cases will turn on their evidence. Claimants are perhaps doing themselves no favours by alleging a variety of matters in the hope that at least one of the points will stand up. Representations antecedent to the sale of PPI insurance may have happened many years previously, and in the absence of proper evidence, claimants will have difficulty in establishing their version of events. And if they spread their complaints across a range of matters, then their burden of proof amplifies accordingly. By way of contrast, case law – particularly that which arose out of the Black Horse litigation – has frequently confirmed that evidence of the processes and scripts followed by lenders at the time of the sale is sufficient in the absence of specific evidence relating to the particular transaction. Therefore, claimants would need to produce the evidence which relates to their own sale, or have a clear recollection of matters which is persuasive enough to be taken over the documentary evidence of procedures put forward by a defendant lender or intermediary. And if this evidence points towards compliance with the regulatory regime in place at the time of the sale, ie ICOB or ICOBS, then the inference will be all the stronger that the sale was properly made. All in all, it seems that the rules of procedure and evidence are being strictly applied in PPI cases, with little room for leaps of faith on the part of the claimant where some aspect of their case falls short. This is of course set against, and likely influenced by, a back-drop of court closures and cuts, resulting in higher burdens, both administratively and judicially, on those which remain.   </p>
<p>So perhaps this particular consumer revolution is drawing to an end. No doubt another will be along to take its place, as the general appetite for litigation is unlikely to be abated for long: the flame continues to cast its allure.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>MAY/JUNE/JULY 2012</h2>
<h2>FSA</h2>
<p><strong>Guide to splitting of the FSA handbook</strong></p>
<p>The FSA has published a one-minute guide to the splitting of the handbook to reflect the dual regulation model due to take effect next year. There will be two handbooks, reflecting the separation of the regulator: one for the Financial Conduct Authority and one for the Prudential Regulation Authority. To support the transition, there will be a version showing both sets of provisions, with each being clearly labelled as to which regulator will have responsibility. The split handbooks are expected to be produced in draft form in early 2013, following consultations on the more substantive changes involved in creating the new regulators.</p>
<p><strong>Fines for inadequate anti-money laundering measures</strong></p>
<p>In May the FSA fined Habib Bank AG Zurich, a private Swiss bank with twelve branches in the UK, £525,000 for failing to take reasonable care to establish and maintain anti-money laundering (AML) systems and controls. Its money laundering reporting officer received a fine of £17,500 for the same matter.</p>
<p>Half of the bank’s deposits came from jurisdictions with less stringent AML requirements than the UK, and it was this fact, together with the perceived higher risk of corruption, which led the FSA to conclude that in the absence of more robust systems, the bank had been exposed to an unacceptable risk of laundering money. Such a failure puts firms in breach of Principle 3.</p>
<p>AML matters were the subject of a recent court decision in Shah –v- HSBC Private Bank (UK) Ltd (2012) [Shah piece sent earlier,maybe link?] which also drew attention to the fact that good procedures are central to compliance with the requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Publication of memoranda of understanding</strong></p>
<p>The FSA recently published a memorandum of understanding between the FSCS and PRA, and a second such memorandum between the FSCS and the FCA, in preparation for when the regulator is formally split next year. In broad terms, the main points that these cover relate to their respective roles, co-ordination, information sharing and confidentiality issues.</p>
<p><strong>Publication of annual report</strong></p>
<p>In June the FSA published what is likely to be its final annual report, measuring its success against five key objectives:</p>
<p>• Executing the Government’s regulatory reform programme.<br />
• Executing a credible deterrence and enforcement approach throughout 2012.<br />
• Delivering the FSA’s financial stability objectives.<br />
• Delivering efficient, clean, orderly and fair markets that remain attractive and sustainable.<br />
• Continued progress in developing a new consumer protection strategy.</p>
<p>The report draws attention to the ways in which it has met its objectives, and refers particularly to its considerable progress in advancing a new proactive approach to consumer protection, both before and after the introduction of the twin peaks model, and in anticipation of the split to come in 2013.</p>
<h2>Office of Fair Trading</h2>
<p><strong>Publication of annual report </strong></p>
<p>In June the OFT published what is likely to be its final annual report. It showed that the benefit to the taxpayer was at least eight times its cost: the estimated saving for consumers was £402 million, set against a running cost of £49 million. The report goes on to look at how the OFT has handled its overarching priorities, set out below, highlighting achievements in supporting these:</p>
<p>• High impact enforcement to achieve compliance with competition and consumer law;<br />
• Influencing and changing behaviour of business, consumers and government in order to make markets work well.</p>
<p>Like the FSA, the OFT has started to focus on the creation of the new regime, whilst continuing to operate a proactive approach to its aims.</p>
<p><strong>Revocation of licence for failing to disclose convictions</strong></p>
<p>On 27 June the appeal period expired in the case of Mr Superloan, a home-collected credit business based in Sunderland, after the licence of the man behind it was revoked by the OFT. The revocation was based upon the failure to disclose numerous convictions relating to offences of violence and dishonesty, the existence of which meant the licence holder was not a fit and proper person to hold such a licence. The business has until the end of July to wind up its commitments.</p>
<p><strong>Wonga required to ensure improved debt collection practices</strong></p>
<p>The online lender Wonga.com, together with some associate companies, was recently required to ensure improved debt collection practices going forward, after the OFT discovered that the wording of one call script and two types of written communication were not acceptable. Wonga explained that the matters related to isolated incidents, and that they had not been used for some time. Nevertheless, the OFT imposed the requirement, which has subsequently been the subject of an appeal by Wonga. The matter is currently lodged with the First Tier Tribunal and is awaiting a response from the OFT.</p>
<h2>Financial Ombudsman Service</h2>
<p><strong>Annual report published</strong></p>
<p>The FOS published its annual report in May and noted the following trends:�<br />
• The ombudsman received over 1.2 million front-line enquiries and complaints from consumers – over 5,000 each working day;<br />
• 1 in 5 of these initial enquiries went on to become formal disputes – a record 264,375 new cases, up 28% on the previous year.<br />
• 157,716 cases (60% of the total) were about the sale of payment protection insurance (PPI)<br />
• All areas of the UK saw similar-sized increases in the number of consumers bringing complaints to the ombudsman – with &#8220;complaint hotspots&#8221; in Glasgow, Swansea and Bristol.<br />
In relation to PPI, the Ombudsman has recently received its 300,000th complaint, making it the most complained about product ever.</p>
<h2>Serious Fraud Office</h2>
<p><strong>LIBOR investigation announced</strong><br />
The Serious Fraud Office has announced that it will formally investigate the allegations relating to the manipulation of the London Inter Bank Borrowing Rate – LIBOR – and its European counterpart, EURIBOR by certain banks. The announcement follows the FSA’s fining of Barclays earlier in July for agreements to fix the rates. The investigation is likely to include the wider financial sector.</p>
<h2>ICO</h2>
<p><strong>Publication of annual report</strong></p>
<p>The ICO published his annual report on 5 July, along with a stern warning that organisations mishandling public information were learning the consequences the hard way – referring to the issuing of fines and other enforcement action of late, which shows that the ICO is certainly baring its teeth.</p>
<p>Since being given the power to issue penalty notices in April 2010, a total of 21 have been issued, with a total value of £2 million in fines. The figures in the report show a slight drop in the number of data protection based complaints, but this is balanced by a rise in those relating to Freedom of Information requests and an increase in complaints about direct marketing calls and texts. On 2 July, the ICO had set up a dedicated report page to allow individuals to report their concerns. Any business attracting a degree of these complaints will have to demonstrate that they are complying with the law, ie, that they have consent for the contact.</p>
<p><strong>Fine for mishandling data</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile the ICO continues to take action against those displaying a cavalier attitude to handling personal data. Recent enforcement action includes:</p>
<p>• £60,000 fine for a NHS trust who sent a vulnerable individual’s sensitive medical details to the wrong address<br />
• A health care provider received a fine of £225,000 after leaving thousands of patient records behind in a disused hospital site<br />
• A council were fined £90,000 following disclosure of sensitive personal information relating to four vulnerable children, who subsequently required rehousing<br />
• £325,000 fine for a NHS trust who failed to destroy highly sensitive and personal data held on hard drives before selling them on<br />
• A council received a fine of £70,000 for losing sensitive and confidential data relating to 15 vulnerable children and young people<br />
• A NHS trust was fined £90,000 for faxing patient details in lists to the wrong recipient over a period of 3 months.

<p>The Yorkshire and Humber Environment Index is a voluntary, business led survey that enables organisations to evaluate and assess the way in which they manage their environmental impacts.</p>
<p>This is the second time we have completed the survey since we became members of Business in the Community in 2010 when we formally began to manage and track the environmental performance of our business.</p>
<p>Anthony Ruane, Lead Property Partner commented: “We are extremely proud to receive the significant improver award from Business in the Community. We have taken a number of steps over the last 24 months to improve the environmental performance of our business and we remain committed to making improvements in this area.”
